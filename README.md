# Drowsiness Driver Detection using YOLOv5 and PyTorch

![Demo](demo.gif)

This project aims to detect driver drowsiness using the YOLOv5 object detection model implemented in PyTorch and fine-tuned for the specific task of drowsiness detection. The project leverages the Ultralytics YOLOv5 model and achieves a Mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 0.995, ensuring high accuracy in real-time drowsiness level computations.

## Features

- Real-time driver drowsiness detection.
- Fine-tuned YOLOv5 model for improved accuracy.
- Continuous monitoring of drowsiness levels.
- Easy-to-use interface and setup.
- Achieves an impressive mAP score of 0.995.
